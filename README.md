# ApiScout ðŸ¤ 

## Introduction

This package uses the Symfony [serializer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/serializer.html)

- Enjoy the magic of an auto generated [Swagger](https://swagger.io) API Documentation
- [MapRequestPayload and MapQueryString](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-6-3-mapping-request-data-to-typed-objects) to deserialize your Request
- Serialize automatically your Response by returning an object to the Controller 
- Nice Symfony [Validation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/validation.html) Response
- A [Pagination](docs/Attributes/GetCollection.md#working-with-pagination) tool to help you with your collections

ApiScout will greatly help you develop your api without reinventing the wheel

You can choose to use those tools as well as not to use them without having to fight against ApiScout.
